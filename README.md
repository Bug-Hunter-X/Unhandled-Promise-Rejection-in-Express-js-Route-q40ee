# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: improper error handling within asynchronous routes.  The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js route that performs an asynchronous operation. If the operation fails, the error is logged to the console but not handled gracefully, resulting in a silent failure or an incomplete response to the client.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, ensuring that errors are caught and appropriate responses (e.g., error status codes) are sent to the client.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js`.  Make multiple requests to the server; some requests may return a 'Hello World!' response, while others will fail silently.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js`.  The corrected code provides better handling.
